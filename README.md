Sounds and Colors!
This fun little project makes use of the HTML 5 canvas. Users can press any letter key on the keyboard and a sound will play along with an animated circle in a random place on the browser window.

Howler.js powers the sound library and Paper.js powers the canvas visual element. Put on your own concert and light show at your desk!
